# 🎯 ADD YOUR LOGO HERE

## Quick Steps:

1. **Find your logo image file** (the emblem with tricolor and shield)

2. **Copy it to this location:**
   ```
   frontend/public/logo.png
   ```

3. **If your file is a different format, rename it:**
   - `logo.jpg` → rename to `logo.png` OR
   - `logo.jpeg` → rename to `logo.png` OR  
   - `logo.svg` → rename to `logo.png`

4. **Restart your dev server:**
   ```powershell
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

## File Location:
```
Ex-Servicemen Service Foundation/
└── frontend/
    └── public/
        └── logo.png  ← PUT YOUR LOGO HERE
```

## What the Logo Should Look Like:
Based on your description, it should be:
- Tricolor background (red, dark blue, light blue stripes)
- White shield with black outline
- Ashoka Chakra, Eagle, Crossed Swords, and Anchor symbols

## Still Not Working?

If you've added the file but it's still not showing:

1. **Check the filename** - Must be exactly `logo.png` (lowercase)
2. **Check the location** - Must be in `frontend/public/` folder
3. **Restart the server** - Vite needs a restart to see new files
4. **Clear browser cache** - Press Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh

## Alternative: Use Image URL

If your logo is hosted online, I can update the code to use a URL instead.
Just provide the image URL and I'll update it!
